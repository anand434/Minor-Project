Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.
Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.
"It isn't a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing."
"Occasional bursts of flames, imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters, come as a relief from the chromatic tedium."
"The movie works. Time and again, the action swells and dips, like a wave, then suddenly delivers a salty slap in the face."
"It is hard to imagine a better tribute to this victory of survival than Nolan's spare, stunning, extraordinarily ambitious film."
"The underlying story and its meticulous re-creation on the big screen completely won me over, as Nolan and his outstanding team deliver scene after scene of heroism, desperation, or that base human instinct for survival."
" ""Dunkirk"" seems to say that there are no heroes in war, only victims, suckers, survivors, and assholes. Perhaps Christopher Nolan's movie has a point after all. This movie sucks."

"It's a comma of compassion in a larger Sisyphean story of war, with Christopher Nolan's contemporaneously unrivaled visual instincts - wedding Storm Thorgerson's surreal photography to David Lean's cinematic majesty."
"The new film of the British director abounds with a new vision in the figure of the unknown soldier from three dramatic spaces: land, sea and air, thus breaking with the idea of a blessed heroism. [Full review in Spanish]"
The film-maker of The Dark Knight gives us a survival tale that celebrates the heroic acts of many.
