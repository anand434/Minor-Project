"One assumes that Cruise got this film made, yet he's a terrible fit for the role: he's always done his best work portraying smart, insightful characters in dramatic stories, but Seal was a yahoo whose sorry escapades are played here for cynical laughs."
"Without realizing it, American Made is a wincing metaphor for Tom Cruise's movie career-which, come to think of it, is exclusively and embarrassingly American made, too."
"The impetuous pace of the film is at one with its moral shamelessness, and, without thinking, we sign up for both."
"[Tom] Cruise gives his energetic all to the role, but he, too, doesn't seem to be quite aware that Seal was morally compromised far beyond the shallow confines of this film."
"It's a morbidly fascinating comedy, an insinuating mock documentary, and a twisted take on the American dream, audaciously masquerading as a high-caliber thriller. It's one of the most enjoyable movies of the year."
"There's an aspirational pleasure in seeing Cruise, now in his mid-50s, jump through these hoops. He knows we prefer him when he shades his easy charm with self-doubt, and Barry has a pleasingly sweaty desperation. But not enough ..."
"The director-star dynamic made a hit of their first movie together (Edge of Tomorrow), and it's what makes American Made work, too."
"Light, fun and exciting... [Full review in Spanish]"
American Made is an undeniably good time.
"The movie's a bit of a mess, but it does enough things really well that it's always fun to watch."
What works best about Cruise in American Made is that it's a role seemingly scripted for him.
American Made is the kind of movie that insists reality is much more implausible - and entertaining - than fiction.
